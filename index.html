    <h1>Understanding Version Control Systems</h1>
    <p>Version control systems (VCS) are essential tools for managing changes to source code over time. They allow multiple developers to collaborate on a project, track changes, and revert to previous versions if necessary.</p>
    <h2>Key Features of Version Control Systems</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Multiple developers can work on the same codebase simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes.</li>
        <li><strong>History Tracking:</strong> Every change made to the code is recorded, allowing developers to see who made what changes and when.</li>
        <li><strong>Branching and Merging:</strong> Developers can create branches to work on new features or bug fixes independently before merging them back into the main codebase.</li>
        <li><strong>Backup and Restore:</strong> VCS provides a safety net by allowing developers to revert to previous versions of the code if something goes wrong.</li>  
    </ul>
    <h2>Popular Version Control Systems</h2>
    <p>Some of the most widely used version control systems include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Git:</strong> A distributed version control system that is widely used in the software development industry. Platforms like GitHub and GitLab are built around Git.</li>
        <li><strong>Subversion (SVN):</strong> A centralized version control system that is still used in some legacy projects.</li>
        <li><strong>Mercurial:</strong> Another distributed version control system that is known for its simplicity and performance.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In conclusion, version control systems are indispensable tools for modern software development, enabling efficient collaboration and robust code management.</p>
